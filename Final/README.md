# Reading Between the Lines
Mathilde Davan

This project is an exploration of data, misuse of data and data visualisation. In this project, I try to make data say nonsense by presenting it in a way that seems credible with a scientific undertone. I then use the same datasets to create more and more abstract visualisations to take away any meaning the first visualisation may have had. The goal is to get people to realise that despite it's objective appearance data can be heavily misused.

Here are links to the datasets I used:

Forest fires: https://ciffc.net/national
Points of interest / Canadian sites: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/cf5c266c-3a6a-4a3b-aed1-2ddd6e49d5e6/resource/3cdca7bf-b422-4e3b-8b96-b1259f4f65ce
