            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Mathilde and I’m not sure how to describe myself… Like every person, I’m pretty complicated with lots of things making me, well… me. One thing that is really important to me though, is places. They are like bubble machines where every bubble is a memory. The most important place to me is my Papy’s house in the south of France in what used to be a small village above Nice. It’s a place that Mamie, when she was still with us, and Papy, poured their heart into creating. They were the ones who built that house and planted all the plants. The garden is almost its own ecosystem from all the exotic plants Mamie brought back in her suitcase from different countries they visited (kids, don’t do that, my grandmother wasn’t giving a good example…). I met the four cats, and two dogs they’ve had since I was born. They always had at least a cat and a dog since my father was young, and soon I will get to meet the cute little Ulysse, the baby dog my aunt got for Papy (his two cats now are called Paris and Priam, Ulysse is to stay in the theme apparently). When I think of this place, I can think of so many fun anecdotes I was told about Bunny, the rabbit, and the crazy Benjamine. It’s also a place where Mamie would introduce us to drawing, embroidering, sewing, and all sorts of crafts like making wheels with clothespins. That place to me is the definition of the words play and exploration. It’s a place where you just have to be you. No pressure, no expectations, no disappointments.</p>

            <p>(Just don’t start talking politics with Papy…)</p>

            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <p>A big point of Lauren McCarthy’s social turk: crowdsourced dating is the use of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for experiments. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was also used in Aaron Koblin and Takashi Kawashima’s project Ten Thousand Cents. In McCarthy’s project, the workers decide her actions during dates while in Koblin and Kawashima’s project, they make the workers draw a $100 bill with each person drawing a tiny little rectangle of the final bill. I think it is interesting to look at how crowdsourcing in these two cases is used in opposite ways. For one, the workers are the ones in control of the situation, they are the ones making the decisions. For the other, the artists are the ones deciding what task they ask of the workers without the workers necessarily knowing what they are working towards. McCarthy mentions in the explanation of her second attempt the question of control. She asks “But who is really in control? Me, as the one using this unknowing guy for my project? Him, because I need his participation, because I need him to like me enough to stay and interact? The workers, because they are determining my words and actions?” This seems like an interesting question when it comes to any kind of crowdsourcing. When looking at Jeff Howe’s text “the Rise of Crowdsourcing”, it seems like the users of crowdsourcing have a certain degree of control as they are the ones defining what they want, however, the workers or turkers are the ones giving back something. In the case of crowdsourced dating, the workers have a lot of control as to what the user of the system will get back. In Ten Thousand Cents, because the workers are human and cannot perfectly replicate what they saw or cared to try to replicate what they saw, the final result has rectangles of different greens next to each other; which one could argue is part of the charm of the project. I think the ones who have the most “control over crowdsourcing” are the ones who created these platforms, for instance InnoCentive itself.</p>
