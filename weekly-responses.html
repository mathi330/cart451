        <p>Hello! I’m Mathilde and I’m not sure how to describe myself… Like every person, I’m pretty complicated with lots of things making me, well… me. One thing that is really important to me though, is places. They are like bubble machines where every bubble is a memory. The most important place to me is my Papy’s house in the south of France in what used to be a small village above Nice. It’s a place that Mamie, when she was still with us, and Papy, poured their heart into creating. They were the ones who built that house and planted all the plants. The garden is almost its own ecosystem from all the exotic plants Mamie brought back in her suitcase from different countries they visited (kids, don’t do that, my grandmother wasn’t giving a good example…). I met the four cats, and two dogs they’ve had since I was born. They always had at least a cat and a dog since my father was young, and soon I will get to meet the cute little Ulysse, the baby dog my aunt got for Papy (his two cats now are called Paris and Priam, Ulysse is to stay in the theme apparently). When I think of this place, I can think of so many fun anecdotes I was told about Bunny, the rabbit, and the crazy Benjamine. It’s also a place where Mamie would introduce us to drawing, embroidering, sewing, and all sorts of crafts like making wheels with clothespins. That place to me is the definition of the words play and exploration. It’s a place where you just have to be you. No pressure, no expectations, no disappointments.

            (Just don’t start talking politics with Papy…)
